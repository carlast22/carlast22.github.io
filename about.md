In my life I wanted to be a doctor, architect, policewomen and lawyer; in the end, I choose journalism as my career. One of my passions is writting and now I write code.

I am a developer at [ThoughtWorks]("https://www.thoughtworks.com/"). I like to read and I work as a producer in a radio program with some friends. I am an activist for gender justice and equality. I am a feminist and a politics trainee. I love photography but I am not a photographer: [https://500px.com/carlast22]("https://500px.com/carlast22").

I believe that social change is possible and that it must start within oneself. If I need to choose one word to describe myself, it would be a *dreamer*. So, these blog is about everything and nothing.
